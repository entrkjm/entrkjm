### Summary
- I'm data analyst specializing in text data from the social media.
  
- I'm in charge of optimazation for large-scale text data importing on cloud storages by writing efficient queries,
and data analysis using python, which includes table manipulation(aggeregation, clustering) and visualization.

- I'm also working on intermediary automation tools as a bridge between data engineers and buisness side employees, to help obtain visualized outupts(using python).

+ Youtube Creator(with +60k subscribers). In this channel, we share business insight for marketers and brand managers, since our main target of data analysis is text data from social media users. As a result of our data configuration, analysis, visualization, we're gaining valuable insights, and the youtube channel is one window to share.

These days, I am particularly interested in **Natural Language Processing(NLP), Machine Learning(fine tuning), Network Management** 

<!-- In my spare time I maintain the [emlearn](https://emlearn.org) open-source software for efficient and convenient ML models on microcontrollers. 
I also provide a few learning resources on [Machine Learning for Embedded](https://github.com/jonnor/embeddedml), and [Machine Learning for Audio](https://github.com/jonnor/machinehearing/). -->
